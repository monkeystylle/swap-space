### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Feature-Based Architecture**:
   - The codebase is organized by features (e.g., `auth`, `bartering`, `messaging`, `profile`) rather than by type (e.g., `components`, `hooks`, `utils`).
   - Each feature contains its own components, hooks, actions, and queries, making it easier to scale and maintain the application.

2. **Server-First Approach**:
   - Leverages Next.js Server Actions for backend operations
   - Server-side authentication and session management
   - Optimized data fetching with React Query

3. **Type Safety**:
   - End-to-end type safety with TypeScript and Prisma
   - Schema validation with Zod for all user inputs and API responses

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npx prisma generate && npx prisma db push
npm run dev
```

**Environment:** Requires PostgreSQL, Cloudinary, Google OAuth, and Resend API keys
